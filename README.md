### DropIn
**Architext**, *July 2015 – Present (1 year)*, *Los Angeles, CA*

- Worked with Valensi Rose, PLC to provide investors with legal and business insight on how to integrate autonomous vehicles into DropIn's business plans.
- Worked with Diamond Web Services and Silicon Prime to bring devops, mobile development, project management, quality assurance, and additional API support into the project.
- Acted as product owner and UX designer for the customer-facing mobile product to establish business logic and discover needed API endpoints.
- Utilized SailsJS, Nginx, MongoDB, Redis, Vagrant, Jasmine, and Supertest to build a RESTful server to fulfil business objectives for account management, operator management, geolocation services, dispatcher services, stream token management, pricing logic, authorization and authentication services, logging, payment and payout management, and timeouts/cleanup tasks for offline users.
- Became very familiar with BrainTree, Stripe, Docusign, Amazon Web Services, ZeroPush, PubNub, PushWoosh, Pusher, Apple Store review, SendGrid, Google Maps, ZenDesk, Loggly, Twilio, OpenTok, and Bill.com.
- Selected JWTs instead of managed sessions to assist with scalability.
- Wrote 500 tests to ensure the core business logic surrounding the dispatching logic works in a variety of cases.
- Documented the dispatching logic and the user experience extensively with code comments, external documentation, flow charts, slideshows, and integration tests.
- Provided considerable insight on how to generate revenue for existing product lines without additional tech expenditures.
- Prepared the company engage in remote UAV operation by structuring the entire API to support the ability to resume a job even if the customer, operator, or server crashes/disconnects.
- Tons of daily code review between 4-5 coders across different timezones.

### CounterTack
**Lead Frontend Developer**, *October 2014 – July 2015 (10 months)*, *Santa Monica, CA*

- Reviewed the technical and business relationships between Windows kernel event tracing, big data behavioral analysis, and Countertack's cybersecurity solution.
- Spearheaded the initiative to rewriting their entire customer-facing UI in React with the purpose of creating reusable UI elements.  The React community had very experimental libraries at this time, so we ended up trying out and throwing away solutions on a near daily basis.
- Spent way too much time writing a lexer from scratch to create contextual autocomplete of CQL statements.  (No, not Cassandra... Contextual Query Language [http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/spec.html])
- Oversaw the hiring process of additional developers given the unique challenges of this situation.  Ultimately selected based on best psychological fit over technical experience since the nature of the challenge was a "pioneer-to-maintainer" position instead of a "permanent hacker of legacy" position.
- Wrote and heavily optimized the build solution using Gulp, Browserify, JSX transpiling, code complexity, linting, Karma testing, uglification with source maps, and a super handy cube that glowed red whenever builds failed and green when they passed.  (Cuts right through email clutter)
- Wrote and militantly enforced extensive testing in Karma (Jest wasn't comprehensive enough) for each UI component to make sure they worked in the intended use cases.  Pull requests without tests would be rejected.
- Played lots of Magic: The Gathering!

### JobSync
**Lead Frontend Developer**, *September 2013 – April 2014 (8 months)*, *Santa Monica, Los Angeles*
- Rewrote the entire primary customer-facing application in five months by myself.
- Learned Python and Django and created a service-oriented REST gateway for the new client, allowing the new client to request back-end data 400% faster than the old client while transferring 67% less bytes to load the new client.
- Created a custom service-oriented front end using KnockoutJS for data-binding, RequireJS for AMD, Nodejs/Grunt for deployment, NPM/NVM for task package management, Karma/PhantomJS/CasperJS for DOM-driven function testing, Bower for front-end package management, SammyJS for URI path management, Bootstrap for CSS, jQuery/jQueryUI for drag-and-drop activity, TouchPunch for mobile touch events, and a reusable library of self-rendering/self-binding DOM elements utilizing my custom solution to mimic AngularJS's directives in KnockoutJS (https://github.com/CodeOtter/knockout-directive).
- Ensured the front-end worked specifically for >=IE7.
- Experimented with NodeJS, Nginx, Siege, and Amazon Micro Instances to serve the entire web application at 1,000 requests/second.
- Implemented GitFlow (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to ensure proper software development planning and deployment.
